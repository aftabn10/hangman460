### Description
Hangman is a classic game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts. This project is a Python implementation of the Hangman game where a random word is chosen from a list, and the user attempts to guess it.

#### Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to create an interactive Hangman game to provide entertainment and for me practice basic programming concepts in Python.

#### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to implement basic game logic, handle user input and enhanced my understanding of Python programming.

### Installation
To run the Hangman game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```python
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd hangman
```

3. Run the game
```python
python hangman.py
```

### Usage
1. Upon running the game, the computer will select a word, and you will be prompted to guess the letters.
2. Enter a letter when prompted.
3. Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
4. Enjoy the game!
